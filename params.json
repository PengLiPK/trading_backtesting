{"name":"Trading backtesting","tagline":"Backtesting method for algorithmic trading","body":"### Backtesting for algorithmic trading\r\nBacktesting is a method of applying trading strategy to historical financial data and evaluating the trading strategy. This program contains financial data downloading, cleansing and storing, trading algorithm building and algorithm deploying.\r\n\r\n#### Data downloading\r\nIt is very easy to use Yahoo API or [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) to download financial data.\r\n* Yahoo API is like:  \r\nhttp://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=GOOG&a=2014&b=1&c=23&d=2015&e=2&f=10\r\n\r\n* Quandl has Python [API](https://www.quandl.com/help/python), you can use the following to dowload data in Python:   \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport Quandl   \r\nmydata = Quandl.get(\"GOOG/NYSE_SPY\")   \r\n```   \r\nThe format of `mydata` is Pandas data format.  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Data cleansing and storing  \r\n[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a great tool for data analysis in Python. Pandas is used for data cleansing, processing, and sometimes plotting.   \r\nHere is a picture of daily closed price of Google plotted by Pandas:   \r\n![close_price](./images/google_cp.png)\r\n\r\nData can be stored on local machines by SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) or other SQLs such as [MySQL Python API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/apis-python.html). SQLAlchemy supports SQLite, Postgresql, MySQL, Oracle, MS-SQL and others.    \r\n\r\n#### Trading algorithm building\r\nBoth analytic model or machine learning method can be used as trading algorithm. The only difference is: ananlytic model can be tested on the entire data; machine learning method can be only tested on the testing data set (The data would be divided as training and tesing set before applying machine learning). The most popular tool of machine learning in Python is [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).\r\n\r\n#### Trading algorithm deploying\r\nAfter having the trading algorithm, you need to build you portfolio according to the trading algorithm. This also includes creating positions, holdings and a set of trading orders.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
